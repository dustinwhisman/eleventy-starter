<!--
Here are some general guidelines for what's appropriate for a GitHub issue compared to another forum :)

Generally, file an issue and expect a response from a maintainer when...

- You've found a bug with clear reproduction steps.
- Document is incorrect or completely missing.
- You have an idea for new functionality you'd like to share for discussion.
- You've thoroughly searched previous issues for related problems and haven't found anything.

Generally, avoid filing an issue and/or don't expect a response from a maintainer when...

- You're wondering how stuff works.
- You'd like help fitting the project into your specific workflow.
- Any other questions that wouldn't require changes to the project or be uniquely answered by project maintainers.

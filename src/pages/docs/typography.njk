  <h1>
    Typography
  </h1>

  <p>
    This is a paragraph, and that thing up there is an h1. By default, we use a
    nice system font stack that should look decent on all browsers and operating
    systems without needing to load any custom fonts.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to host your own custom fonts, we recommend defining the
    font-faces in <code>scss/settings/_fonts.scss</code> and putting the font
    files in the <code>fonts</code> folder.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is another paragraph, and since this page is wrapped in a stack
    component, there will be a nice vertical rhythm throughout the whole page.
  </p>

  <h2>
    This is an h2.
  </h2>

  <p>
    There is extra space added above heading elements in order to make it clear
    that a new section has started.
  </p>

  <h3>
    This is an h3.
  </h3>

  <h4>
    This is an h4.
  </h4>

  <h5>
    This is an h5.
  </h5>

  <h6>
    This is an h6.
  </h6>

  <p>
    This is a paragraph. It is capped at a max width defined in the theme of
    your site. Most things will adhere to the same max width, but paragraphs are
    one of the more likely tags to surpass that limit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since this is a new paragraph and it's still in the stack component, there
    will be a separation between the two paragraphs. A margin is added to to the
    top of all but the first child elements of the stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an unordered list.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Here's an item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Here's another item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Here's a third item that has loads of extra text that will make it wrap
      once it passes its max width.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is an ordered list.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Here's item #1.
    </li>
    <li>
      Here's item #2.
    </li>
    <li>
      Here's item #3, which has a bunch of text that will make it wrap once it
      passes its max width.
    </li>
  </ol>
